Based on what you see in X_DOC, can you create specific user journeys for these goals and objectives?


Based on what you see in X_DOC , we are going to be making a checklist. Before we start, I want you to take a look at our objectives and report back what you see the main objectives to be. I also want you to ask me any necessary questions for clarification.

The rules to making a checklist can be found in HE_RE . Please create a checklist ranked by what is most foundational to get things done, and be as meticulous as possible with requirements. Do not add requirements without asking, but do think through what needs to be done in order to meet our objectives. You may write the objectives in a markdown file and save it to zdocs/checklist .
