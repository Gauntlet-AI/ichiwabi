- Please carefully look over our requirements and generate user journeys for Workers and Customers


- Please carefully look over our requirements and outline the categories that our deliverables fit into.
	- Please prioritize these categories based on what is the most important groundwork for the rest of the project. Deprioritize elements that are easy to add later or are simply "nice-to-have" but non-essential for operations. We want our groundwork to be laid before anything else.


- Create a Data model based on your knowledge of the following: We are using a Ticket-centered data model (as outlined in [[project-overview-original]]). As I see it, we will need Customers, Tickets, Messages (which belong to Tickets), Workers, and Organizations (which all the following belong to), Notes (Internal Notation that is related to a specific Ticket), Teams (each with a focus area; there will be multiple teams and Workers can belong to multiple teams) and Templates (which can have created_by related to Worker, tags, etc). Am I missing anything?

- Please ask me any questions for Clarification
