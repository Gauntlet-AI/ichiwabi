# Goal
---
We are building a TikTok-like short video creation application. Our application will be Creator-focused, so we will initially be focusing on video creation.

Our unique proposition is to have new prompts every day that people can generate videos around. These questions are meant to promote an actual social aspect, like "What Pokemon type would you be and why". Every day there will be a new question to respond to, creating a ritual-based application.


# Tech Stack
---
- Swift & XCode
- Cursor
- Firebase (Auth)
- Firestore (Database for real-time data management)
- SwiftData (for local device and offline persistance)
- OpenShot Video Editing API with AWS

# Features
---
- Generate Video based on Daily Prompts
- Share video with our specific watermark to any other service
