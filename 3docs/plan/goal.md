We are building a TikTok-like short video creation application focused on dream sharing. Our application will be Creator-focused, with an emphasis on video creation.

Our unique proposition is to provide a platform where people can record and share their dreams through short-form videos. This creates an intimate and engaging social experience, as dreams are deeply personal yet universally relatable experiences that everyone has. Users can capture and share their dream experiences while they're still fresh in their memory, creating a fascinating archive of human subconsciousness.
