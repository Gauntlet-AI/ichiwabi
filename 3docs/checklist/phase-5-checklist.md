# Phase 5 Streak Management Checklist

## Considerations (Require Decisions)
- [ ] Determine streak history retention policy
  - [ ] Document storage implications
  - [ ] Consider analytics requirements
- [ ] Evaluate local streak caching strategy
  - [ ] Assess offline functionality needs
  - [ ] Consider SwiftData implementation
- [ ] Design cross-device synchronization approach
  - [ ] Document potential race conditions
  - [ ] Plan conflict resolution strategy

## Streak Data Structure
- [ ] Create streak tracking model
  - [ ] Current streak counter
  - [ ] Total videos counter
  - [ ] Last response timestamp
- [ ] Set up Firestore streak collection
  - [ ] Design document structure
  - [ ] Implement security rules
- [ ] Create streak update service
  - [ ] Handle increment logic
  - [ ] Handle streak reset logic

## Streak Logic Implementation
- [ ] Implement core streak rules
  - [ ] Verify response within JST day
  - [ ] Check for duplicate responses
  - [ ] Handle streak reset conditions
- [ ] Create streak calculation service
  - [ ] Implement JST-based day boundary logic
  - [ ] Handle timezone conversions
- [ ] Set up real-time streak updates
  - [ ] Configure Firestore listeners
  - [ ] Implement immediate UI updates

## Notification System
- [ ] Implement end-of-day reminder
  - [ ] Configure 23:00 JST notification
  - [ ] Create notification content
  - [ ] Handle notification permissions
- [ ] Set up notification triggers
  - [ ] Check user response status
  - [ ] Handle timezone calculations
  - [ ] Implement do-not-disturb respect

## UI Implementation
- [ ] Design streak display components
  - [ ] Create current streak counter
  - [ ] Display total videos count
- [ ] Implement streak update animations
  - [ ] Design increment animation
  - [ ] Design reset animation
- [ ] Add streak status indicators
  - [ ] Show active/broken state
  - [ ] Display last response time

## Warnings and Considerations
- ⚠️ Ensure accurate timezone handling for JST calculations
- ⚠️ Plan for scalability of streak tracking system
- ⚠️ Consider Firebase read/write limitations with real-time updates
- ⚠️ Handle edge cases around date boundary (23:59-00:01)
- ⚠️ Ensure proper error handling for failed streak updates
- ⚠️ Consider notification reliability across different iOS versions
- ⚠️ Test streak logic thoroughly with different usage patterns
- ⚠️ Monitor performance impact of real-time listeners
