## Warnings and Considerations
- ⚠️ Testing setup will need adjustment once requirements are finalized
- ⚠️ Performance metrics cannot be set until device requirements are defined
- ⚠️ Test data generation may need to wait for format finalization
- ⚠️ Some features may need different testing approaches based on final implementation
- ⚠️ Testing infrastructure costs should be considered
- ⚠️ CI/CD setup may need adjustment based on team needs
- ⚠️ Test coverage targets should align with app criticality
- ⚠️ Consider testing impact on development timeline
