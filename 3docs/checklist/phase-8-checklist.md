## Warnings and Considerations
- ⚠️ Testing setup can significantly impact development timeline
- ⚠️ Testing infrastructure may have additional costs
- ⚠️ Different testing approaches require different expertise
- ⚠️ Some features (video processing, notifications) are harder to test
- ⚠️ Testing environments need maintenance
- ⚠️ Real device testing may require device procurement
- ⚠️ Firebase/OpenShot testing may need separate accounts/infrastructure
- ⚠️ Consider time investment vs. benefit for different testing approaches
