## Warnings and Considerations
- ⚠️ AVFoundation implementation may vary across iOS versions
- ⚠️ OpenShot integration decision will significantly impact architecture
- ⚠️ Video processing can be resource-intensive - need to consider older devices
- ⚠️ Firebase Storage costs will scale with video size and user count
- ⚠️ Need to handle interrupted uploads gracefully
- ⚠️ Consider privacy permissions (camera, photo library)
- ⚠️ Test recording and processing with various lighting conditions
- ⚠️ Ensure proper memory management during video processing
