# AI Dream Video Generation Implementation Checklist

## UI Components
- [x] Create "Make my Dream Real" button overlay for video player
  - [x] Design animated gradient background for button
  - [x] Implement pulsing/glowing animation effect
  - [x] Position button centered over video with proper padding
  - [x] Add tap gesture handler

- [x] Implement loading screen overlay
  - [x] Design gradient background animation
  - [x] Create pulsing text animations for status messages
  - [x] Implement progress indicators for different stages:
    - [x] "Generating your dream..."
    - [x] "Processing video..."
    - [x] "Adding audio..."
    - [x] "Applying finishing touches..."
    - [x] "Uploading to cloud..."
  - [x] Add smooth transitions between stages

## API Integration
- [x] Create VideoGenerationService
  - [x] Implement /generate-video API endpoint call
  - [x] Handle API response and error cases
  - [x] Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
  - [x] Parse and validate returned video URL

## Video Processing
- [x] Extend VideoProcessingService for AI-generated videos
  - [x] Download video from API response URL
  - [x] Apply watermark to new video
  - [x] Merge original audio with new video
  - [x] Ensure proper video orientation and quality
  - [x] Handle processing errors gracefully

## Storage & Database
- [x] Update Firebase storage implementation
  - [x] Add specific handling for AI-generated videos
  - [x] Update video URL in Firestore with AI flag
  - [x] Handle upload errors and retries
  - [x] Clean up temporary files

## State Management
- [x] Add AI generation status tracking to Dream model
  - [x] Add isAIGenerated flag to Dream model
  - [x] Add aiGeneratedVideoURL property (using originalVideoURL)
  - [x] Prevent multiple generations for same dream (using isAIGenerated flag)
  - [x] Handle generation state persistence (using ProcessingStatus)

## Error Handling
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
  - [x] API call failures
  - [x] Video processing errors
  - [x] Network connectivity issues
  - [x] Storage-specific error cases
  - [x] Display user-friendly error messages

## Warnings
- API response times may vary significantly depending on video complexity
- Video processing is resource-intensive and may impact device performance
- Network bandwidth usage will be high during video download/upload
- Need to ensure proper cleanup of temporary files to manage storage space
- Consider implementing timeout handling for long-running API calls
