# Firebase Setup and Onboarding Implementation Log

## Date: March 2024

### Summary
Successfully set up Firebase integration and implemented the onboarding flow for the ichiwabi app. This included configuring Firebase services, implementing user authentication, and creating the initial onboarding experience.

### Completed Tasks

#### Firebase Configuration
1. Set up Firebase project "ichiwabi"
2. Configured Firebase in the app using `FirebaseConfig.swift`
3. Implemented Firebase emulator support for development
4. Created Firestore database in test mode

#### User Authentication & Data Model
1. Implemented `UserSyncService` for handling user data synchronization
2. Created `User` model with SwiftData and Firestore integration
3. Set up proper error handling and validation
4. Implemented sync status tracking

#### Onboarding Flow
1. Created multi-step onboarding process:
   - Username and display name input
   - Profile photo selection and catchphrase
   - Terms of Service acceptance
2. Implemented validation for user inputs
3. Added progress tracking through onboarding steps
4. Created UI for photo selection (pending storage implementation)

#### Data Synchronization
1. Implemented SwiftData and Firestore synchronization
2. Set up proper error handling for offline scenarios
3. Created conflict resolution strategies
4. Implemented real-time updates capability

### Current Status
- âœ… Basic Firebase configuration
- âœ… Firestore database setup
- âœ… User authentication
- âœ… Basic profile creation
- âœ… Local data persistence
- âœ… Cloud data synchronization
- ðŸš§ Photo upload functionality (pending Firebase Storage implementation)

### Next Steps
1. Implement Firebase Storage for profile photos
2. Create proper photo upload functionality
3. Update profile photo URLs in both SwiftData and Firestore
4. Implement photo caching and loading states

### Technical Notes
- Using Firebase Emulators for local development
- SwiftData for local persistence
- Firestore for cloud storage
