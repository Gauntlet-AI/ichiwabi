# Phase 1 Implementation Log

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Data Layer
1. **SwiftData + Firestore Hybrid Approach**
   - Using SwiftData for local persistence
   - Firestore for cloud storage and sync
   - Implemented generic sync architecture for consistency

2. **Model Structure**
   - Core Models:
     - `User`: Profile and authentication data
     - `Prompt`: Daily questions and challenges
     - `VideoResponse`: User-generated video content
     - `Comment`: Response interactions
   - Supporting Models:
     - `Notification`: In-app notifications
     - `Settings`: User preferences
     - `Report`: Content moderation

3. **Sync Architecture**
   - Created `SyncableModel` protocol for standardized sync operations
   - Implemented `BaseSyncService` with generic sync capabilities
   - Model-specific services (e.g., `UserSyncService`) for custom logic
   - Comprehensive offline support with pending changes queue

### Implementation Details

#### SwiftData Configuration
- Schema Version: 1
- Models marked with `@Model` attribute
- Relationships configured with appropriate delete rules
- Integrated with SwiftUI via `modelContainer` modifier

#### Firestore Structure
- Collections:
  - `users/{userId}`
  - `prompts/{promptId}`
  - `responses/{responseId}`
  - Subcollections:
    - `users/{userId}/relationships`
    - `users/{userId}/activity`
    - `responses/{responseId}/comments`

#### Sync Implementation
1. **Offline Support**
   - Network monitoring with `NWPathMonitor`
   - Automatic sync on network restoration
   - Local-first updates with pending changes queue

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Timestamp-based conflict detection
   - Smart merging strategy preserving latest changes
   - Configurable per model type

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Efficient batch updates for multiple records
   - Transaction support for atomic operations
   - Automatic retry mechanism

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created `SyncTestService` for verification
- Test cases cover:
  - Basic sync operations
  - Offline behavior
  - Conflict resolution
- Integrated test UI for manual verification

## Technical Decisions

### Why SwiftData?
- Native Apple solution
- Seamless SwiftUI integration
- Modern async/await support
- Schema migration tools

### Why Firestore?
- Real-time capabilities
- Flexible document structure
- Robust offline support
- Scalable for future growth

### Sync Strategy Choices
1. **Local-First Updates**
   - Immediate local updates
   - Background sync to Firestore
   - Better user experience
   - Robust offline support

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Last-write-wins for simple fields
   - Smart merging for complex data
   - Preserves user intent

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Reduces network calls
   - Improves performance
   - Maintains data consistency

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Consider sharding for high-traffic collections

### Data Migration
- Plan for schema evolution
- Version control for data models
- Migration path for existing data

### Performance
- Monitor sync operation performance
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Optimize batch operation sizes

### Security
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Set up Firestore security rules
- Regular security audits

## Known Limitations

1. **SwiftData**
   - Relatively new technology
   - Limited community resources
   - Potential undiscovered issues

2. **Offline Sync**
   - Complex conflict scenarios possible
   - Memory usage with large pending queues
   - Network bandwidth considerations

3. **Testing**
   - Manual testing required for some scenarios
   - Network condition simulation needed
   - Real-world testing recommended
