# Camera Cleanup and SwiftData Model Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SIGABRT Error in VideoCaptureService
The app was crashing with a SIGABRT error during cleanup of camera resources. The root causes were:
- Multiple simultaneous cleanup calls
- Weak reference issues during deallocation
- Improper thread handling for cleanup operations

### 2. SwiftData Model Migration Error
The app was failing to load the persistent store due to model migration issues with:
- Inconsistent property types
- Improper attribute annotations

## Solutions Implemented

### VideoCaptureService Cleanup Fix
1. Added cleanup state tracking:
```swift
private var isBeingCleaned = false
```

2. Implemented safe cleanup process:
```swift
nonisolated func cleanup() {
    Task { @MainActor [weak self] in
        guard let self = self else { return }
        
        // Prevent multiple cleanups
        guard !self.isBeingCleaned else {
            print("ðŸ“· Cleanup already in progress, skipping")
            return
        }
        self.isBeingCleaned = true
        
        // Cleanup implementation...
    }
}
```

3. Proper thread handling:
- Main thread for state updates
- Session queue for AVFoundation operations
- Async cleanup operations with proper weak self references

4. Removed cleanup from deinit:
```swift
deinit {
    // Don't call cleanup in deinit to prevent retain cycles
    // Cleanup should be called by onDisappear
}
```

### SwiftData Model Fix
1. Simplified model annotations:
```swift
@Model
final class Dream {
    @Attribute(.unique) var dreamId: UUID
    var videoURL: URL  // Native URL handling
    var tags: [String] = []  // Native array handling
    // ... other properties
}
```

2. Removed unnecessary transformable attributes:
- Let SwiftData handle URL and array types natively
- Simplified the model structure

## Testing Steps
1. Delete app from simulator/device
2. Clean build folder (Cmd + Shift + K)
3. Build and run again

## Key Learnings
1. Always ensure cleanup operations are thread-safe and properly sequenced
2. Use state tracking to prevent multiple simultaneous cleanup attempts
3. Be cautious with cleanup in deinit - prefer explicit cleanup at view disappearance
4. Let SwiftData handle common types natively when possible
5. Proper weak self usage in async operations to prevent retain cycles
