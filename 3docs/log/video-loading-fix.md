# Video Loading Fix - Path Structure Resolution

## Issue
The app was failing to load videos after downloading them from Firebase Storage. The specific symptoms were:
1. Videos would download successfully from Firebase
2. Local paths were being saved in the database
3. The app couldn't find the videos when trying to play them
4. Error message: "Downloaded video file not found"

## Root Cause
The issue was a mismatch in path structures between different parts of the app:

1. `VideoUploadService` was saving files in a nested structure:
   ```
   documents/
   └── dreams/
       └── userId/
           └── video.mp4
   ```

2. But `DreamPlaybackView` and `DreamSyncService` were looking for files in the root directory:
   ```
   documents/
   └── video.mp4
   ```

## Solution
1. Standardized the path structure across all services to use:
   ```
   documents/
   └── dreams/
       └── userId/
           └── video.mp4
   ```

2. Modified path handling in both services:
   - `DreamSyncService` now constructs the full path: `dreams/userId/filename.mp4`
   - `DreamPlaybackView` uses the same path structure when looking for videos
   - Only the filename is stored in `dream.localVideoPath`
   - Full path is constructed when needed using `userId`

3. Added verification steps:
   - Check if file exists before attempting playback
   - Clear invalid local paths if file is missing
   - Verify file existence after download
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the process

## Implementation Details
1. In `DreamSyncService`:
   ```swift
   let fullPath = "dreams/\(dream.userId)/\(localPath)"
   let localURL = documentsPath.appendingPathComponent(fullPath)
   ```

2. In `DreamPlaybackView`:
   ```swift
   let fullPath = "dreams/\(dream.userId)/\(localPath)"
   let localURL = documentsPath.appendingPathComponent(fullPath)
   ```

3. File verification:
   ```swift
   if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: localURL.path) {
       // Use file
   } else {
       // Clear invalid path and trigger re-download
   }
   ```

## Results
- Videos now download and play successfully
- Local storage is properly organized by user
- Invalid paths are automatically cleaned up
- Process is more resilient to missing files

## Lessons Learned
1. Importance of consistent path structures across services
2. Need for verification at multiple steps
3. Value of detailed logging for debugging
4. Benefits of cleaning up invalid state instead of failing
